                                <ul>
                                    <li>Legal restrictions:
                                        <br /> There may be some countries which have legal restrictions prohibiting
                                        your favorite
                                        stations from broadcasting worldwide. It has to be possible to connect to them
                                        from my server
                                        located in Germany.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>High Costs:
                                        <br /> Some others would allow global broadcast but let the stations pay huge
                                        amounts of money to
                                        copyright owners if they want to do that. Please talk to your station or your
                                        local political
                                        representatives to ensure the freedom of global
                                        broadcasting.

                                    <li>Status not up to date:<br />
                                        Sometimes streams go down for some time. If the automatic check happens to be
                                        there at this exact
                                        time, they will be marked as broken. It will take some time that this station is
                                        checked again and
                                        marked
                                        as usable.

                                You have to do the following steps:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Do a DNS lookup of all.api.radio-browser.info for all IP addresses. It will
                                        always return all
                                        available first level servers.</li>
                                    <li>Filter out doubles</li>
                                    <li>Do a reverse lookup for all remaining IPs.</li>
                                    <li>Add "https://" in front of each of them.</li>
                                    <li>Randomize the list and choose the first one as base url. If a request fails
                                        continue to the next server in your list.</li>
                                </ol>
                                This steps will ensure that the users of your app will always have a working connection
                                to a server.

                                Use the git project at <a

                                which powers the new first level servers. It will automatically mirror the main
                                servers because it supports federation. This is probably your easiest bet.

                                YES, the new API <a

                                does have federation.<br />
                                This means that changes on one server will automatically be pulled from all the other
                                servers and incorporated into their data. Consistency is kept by giving each change a
                                distinct
                                unique ID (<a

                                Every server keeps a station change history including all additions and changes.
                                This can be pulled from other servers as a full version or as a differential from the
                                state they already have.
                                Each server also keeps a history of station checks, which can also be pulled in a
                                similiar fashion.<br /><br />
                                Some servers do checks themselves, so there are multiple sources of checks from
                                different countries. Checks from multiple sources
                                for one station are combined into a majority vote (offline/online) state.

                    </div>
                    <div class="panel-body">
                        There are plans to improve radio-browser even further. These are just the biggest things on my
                        mind. More are on the
                        issue pages on GitHub and there is also the place where you can add your ideas and discuss them
                        with others. The main goal of radio-browser was always and will always be to make it as
                        AUTOMATIC
                        and as SIMPLE to use and as OPEN as possible. If there is a sensible way to make it automatic
                        then we should
                        at least think about it. With this in mind the following points should give you an idea about
                        the main direction of the project.
                        <dl>
                            <dt>Short term</dt>
                            <dd>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Extract more meta information from stream (country, language, ...). A good
                                        starting point would be <a
                                            href="https://www.stream-meta.info/">www.stream-meta.info</a>. This should
                                        then be used to allow
                                        stream owners to override information in the database for their own streams.
                                        They know best what their own streams are, where they are located, what the
                                        language spoken is etc..
                                        This just extends an already existing way of providing metainformation.
                                        Overriding database information will be an opt-in for stream owners. This is
                                        because
                                        at the moment a lot of streams do have wrong or empty metainformation fields.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Automatically delete streams that have the same link or do have the same
                                        resolved link to
                                        clean up the database. Always keep the oldest one to ensure that it is not
                                        possible
                                        to circumvent the edit-block for streams.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>Promote adding of more meta information to the streams out there so they can be
                                        updated from the stream owners themselves. Document how to add metainformation
                                        on software that stream owners use.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>To make this easier for them it should also be
                                        promoted to software
                                        projects for streaming audio and video (like icecast, shoutcast) to add more
                                        metainformation fields (like language, country, ..).
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>It should be easier to add streams to the list just by adding the webpage of the
                                        stream. The idea is that
                                        radio-browser should act more like a web-crawler than now by searching a given
                                        web page for usable streams.
                                        This would make it much easier for users who do not know what stream urls are to
                                        add them to the database.</li>

                            through
                            the still open tickets of the frontend github projects and somebody wished for this. This
                            made
                            me think about the past and I think I am now at this age .. :)

                            Some dates may be not completely accurate, but I do not remember things by date so I had to
                            search through the repositories. I may have started sooner on some projects but commited
                            them to
                            github only later. I gave a link to the source, if there is one.

                                <p>
                                    The history of radio-browser.info goes back to my university days and it was a very
                                    different project at that time.
                                    I always liked listening to online radio while programming and studiing while using
                                    linux. There were some players for
                                    radio in linux. <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/streamtuner/">StreamTuner</a> was an
                                    interesting tool, but it did not have the stations I wanted to listen to.
                                    I also disliked it to be a separate program, which
                                    made the user need to import the stream in her/his favourite music player, which was
                                    rhythmbox at the time for me.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I thought it should be simple to augment rhythmbox with a plugin and I knew the <a
                                        href="http://dir.xiph.org/">icecast directory</a> as a first simple start. It
                                    was xml based
                                    so I tried to write a plugin for rhythmbox myself that would allow basic searching
                                    and playing of streams from icecast.
                                    Why the first version on my homepage was 2.0 I was actually not able to remember :)
                                    But I assume there was an attempt before which version 2.0 broke
                                    compatibility to.

                                    Not short after starting rhythmbox-icecast I found that having only one source of
                                    streaming data is not really cool. There were a lot of sources out
                                    there and I tried to add more of them. So I decided to change the name to
                                    <i>rhythmbox-radio-browser</i> and added the shoutcast directory as a source to the
                                    plugin.
                                </p>
                                <p>The thing I was missing was to have a central list of my favourite streams that I
                                    could not find in icecast or shoutcast directories. They just did not have streams
                                    of real over the air
                                    stations from my local area. There were streams on their respective websites but I
                                    did not always want to first
                                    search stations in the searching machine of my choice, find a stream on their
                                    website, and press play.
                                    It would be much nicer to just have a list of streams in a single place to search
                                    and switch streams much easier and faster.
                                    So I created an xml file with a list of my favourite streams and put it on my own
                                    webservice, so also other people could
                                    benefit from it. The plugin would then download this xml file as a third source of
                                    information.

                                    Arround version 1.8 I think (I actually had to look it up in the history :) ) I put
                                    my knowledge of PHP together and finally found a free PHP
                                    service online. At least I think it was free, I did not have a credit card at the
                                    time to make internet payments, and as a student money was always short.
                                    It was <a href="http://bplaced.net">bplaced.net</a> if anybody can remember and it
                                    was good enough to have a very basic webservice running that generated
                                    xml that the rhythmbox plugin could ingest.

                                    as possible, something like start and forget was the idea. Searching cheap

                                    The good thing about having an API is that you can use it in a lot of different
                                    places and something I liked to have
                                    was using the API inside the daily path to work or in the subway at night before
                                    sleep in bed (or even while sleeping :) ). And as with a lot of programming
                                    projects, it was about learning something
                                    new, how to create a simple app. I just really like programming :)

                                    I do not know when it happened but the good thing about having a public facing
                                    project like an app is, that
                                    a lot of people get to know you and are even willing to fill in some programming
                                    hours. So there are now some
                                    regular helpers that took the main load of maintaining radiodroid away from my
                                    shoulders and I could focus on the
                                    backend side again. Thank you a lot <a

                                    The initial PHP based website was now online for some years and it was still not
                                    really open. Not because I wanted it private
                                    but because I never planned for it to get this big. It was a really cool feeling
                                    when I first saw that people really added streams to it
                                    via the webpage. It was one of those very old school kind of php pages, that do
                                    everything in one php file, doing changes to the database and showing the poorly
                                    styled outcome to
                                    the user. Styling stuff was never my strong side, and I think it still shows ;)
                                    Practically no one knew that it even existed, I never did advertise
                                    it. I just put it out there, and some people found the rhythmbox plugin and used it.
                                    The API was also not documented so I was quite surprised when looking through the
                                    webserver logs
                                    I found that other people used the API. So somebody found it usefull enough to look
                                    at the code of the plugin, try to understand it and then use it in their own
                                    project. There the idea was born: I need to create a real API and more importantly
                                    DOCUMENT it :)

                                    The database grew steadily but many streams did not work anymore when trying to play
                                    them. Endpoints change and keeping up with it is a task only a few people wanted to
                                    do. The database got more crowded with unusable entries und less every day. I
                                    thought we live in the computer age, and still we are checking streams our selves.
                                    This needs to change.

                                    When looking at a internet stream you can see a few extra headers most of the time.
                                    They are added by the streaming software and date back to the big era of shoutcast.
                                    They set the standard, but they did never say it is one. You can read some basic
                                    things from them:
                                    i am an audio stream, this is my bitrate and name and some other stuff. Why not use
                                    them to find out if on the endpoint in the database there is still somebody
                                    listening for connections? Extracting some metainformation for display to the api
                                    user would then be just a nice byproduct. Of course not every stream did support
                                    this, but for most it was a good way and after going through a lot of edge cases I
                                    enabled the cronjob on the server,
                                    and all broken streams got deleted, without any user intervention. Now the database
                                    was usable again.

                                <p>While I never had a huge love for PHP, the backend implementation in php worked quite
                                    good for a long time. It did not have a big need
                                    for maintenance and it was cheap in expenses but I always felt there are better
                                    solutions for APIs. Rust, a systems level programming language, is maybe not
                                    something people would see as the optimal platform for creating a web api, but the
                                    more I read about it and its positive attributes the more I wanted to use it for a
                                    project. Finally I laid the plan
                                    to use Node.JS to rest (pun intended) and started working on a basic
                                    reimplementation of radiobrowser-api.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It took quite a while until I had most features ready and even then I did only
                                    deploy it as a second level server
                                    to the main server which still ran the PHP backend. I needed at least pull support
                                    for the older API
                                    so that every change anybody made on the main server did automatically replicate to
                                    the new deployment. At the time quite a few projects already used radio-browser.info
                                    as their backend, so I wanted to keep
                                    most endpoints the same to make migration easier later.
                                    The plan to run the new software at a different DNS name (*.api.radio-browser.info)
                                    had 3 reasons:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>I wanted to make different endpoints for every country as soon as federation
                                        would work</li>
                                    <li>Spliting the website from the webservice to 2 different DNS names was something
                                        I was thinking about for some time already. I should have done this sooner, when
                                        I started creating the second PHP backend which had a defined API.</li>

                                <p>
                                    A few hard days did lay behind me at that time. A lot of streams that had the
                                    highest vote count had been edited and their content
                                    had been changed in a way that their names were filled with hate against germany and
                                    german people. A lot of people tried to help, and in the end I had to disable
                                    editing and to revert to an older database snapshot. (Good thing to have daily
                                    backups) But what happened?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    One day I did find some streams had been changed. Their names were full of hate and
                                    some things were even legally problematic. Maybe I even got late to the party, this
                                    was going on for some days already. But other people had undone most damage already.
                                    I also started fixing streams manually. This continued on for some days. More and
                                    more people were annoyed because of this damage to the database. At some point a
                                    huge chunk of data got destroyed at once. It seemed a single attacker created a
                                    script to change streams in bulk. This made it even harder to fix streams for a
                                    relatively small number of people to fix streams again and again, when it is so easy
                                    to destroy the work of many hours in a few seconds.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    People tried even to reach out to the attacker by changing stream names to messages,
                                    so that the attacker may eventually read them. I was not involved in this, but in
                                    the end a friendly guy on the internet wrote me an email with the full story. They
                                    basically managed to open an anonymous chat channel to this guy and asked him about
                                    his motivations. He talked so the email stated a lot about stations with wrong
                                    information he did not like in radio-browser. (I know, strange isn't it? he
                                    complains about wrong information, but he does not help but break things even more.)
                                    Then he started talking more and more about a stream database he built and which did
                                    have more correct information. He also hinted at beeing willing to sell it. (now we
                                    are
                                    getting somewhere here, was this his real intention?)
                                    They could not convince him to stop destroying the database further, so when I read
                                    this mail I felt this was a point where something needed to be changed for
                                    radio-browser to be able to stay alive. And that fast!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I disabled all editing and deleting endpoints of the api as a first step. A good
                                    thing I had started creating daily backups for radio-browser quite a while ago. I
                                    wrote some fixing scripts and could undo the damage in faster way. But I decided
                                    that edit would stay disabled until I have a good solution for this.

                                    Having an easy API makes it not only easy for good people to contribute, but also
                                    for others ;(

                                <p>From the beginning I wanted to harden radiobrowser-api-rust against future load, make
                                    it ready for more and more people. But it took quite a while until
                                    I had a syncing mechanism that I did not hate. Syncing is still not perfect and
                                    there is are a few lines where I still not have a good solution yet, but for me
                                    syncing meant federation.
                                    I never did want to own the full stack and run the only servers. The
                                    idea was that
                                    everyone could start and run radio-browser backend on her/his infrastructure. This
                                    makes it much more resistant to internet problems.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A downside to this all can still be felt today, there is no loadbalancer. A client
                                    has to find a suitable
                                    server itsself by looking at the dns. I liked the idea because dns is so bare bones
                                    that I could trust it
                                    at least to next atomic war and maybe even boyond. This of course makes
                                    implementation of clients harder,
                                    there is no single endpoint you call. There is an endpoint
                                    all.api.radio-browser.info which has IPs of all servers
                                    but it does not work for SSL. I use <a
                                        href="https://letsencrypt.org/">letsencrypt</a>, which makes the deployment of a
                                    single
                                    server easy but there is no good and automatic solution if you want to give multiple
                                    servers the same dns name.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But for me it was always about creating a good solution that will last, so I see
                                    radio-browser still in its infancy age.
                                    All this principles and freedoms are now enshrined on the main api documentation

                                    This was a task that was long in the making, but finally I reached the goal: Making
                                    it possible for stream owners to <a
                                        href="https://www.radio-browser.info/#!/owners">change their own database
                                        entries</a>. But how did I get here?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I was never happy with disabling and later removing edit functionality completely
                                    but I did not have a better idea. Some people suggested
                                    creating logins, but getting through the hassle of user logins.. I really did not
                                    like that idea, also I thought it does not solve anything.
                                    Having a login does not make you a good person and I still wanted to keep the
                                    registering process if any open to all. No there had to be a better solution. Maybe
                                    there is an automatic way of doing things. Is
                                    there anyone in the equation who has the correct meta information for the stream and
                                    maybe also has an incentive to provide it?
                                    Then I thought that I already extract metainformation from the streams. Could I
                                    maybe extend that principle? The idea starting growing over time and I started by
                                    extending the (not really) existing standard which a lot of streams already
                                    implement. The result can be seen on <a
                                        href="https://www.stream-meta.info/">www.stream-meta.info</a>.
                                    Implementing it in the backend was almost easy then.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I see a future where all streams do provide more metainformation and radio-browser
                                    gets more the role of a web-crawler. Just searching the web for streams and adding
                                    them to the database. It would index metainformation like the logo, language or
                                    geolocation of the stream. Stream owners
                                    would actually want to feed it complete information to make it easier to find their
                                    stream. People could point the crawler to new undiscovered places
                                    and even other people could then begin to build crawlers that may be better than
                                    radio-browser. But at that point radio-browser would have made the internet more
                                    open, more self descriptive and this would be far more important.
                                    Yeah I know there also would be a downside, the same there is with other crawlers:
                                    "search engine optimization", but at least it would be an open crawler, with open
                                    algorithms.
